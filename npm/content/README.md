# Tabs: Requests Navigator (Fork)

This is a fork of [insomnia-plugin-request-navigator](https://github.com/NickRimmer/insomnia-plugin-request-navigator) originally developed by [Nick Rimmer](https://github.com/NickRimmer).  
This fork was created because the original package is no longer maintained by its author and there was a bug that prevented the plugin from functioning correctly in the latest version of Insomnia.  

## About
Playing hide-and-seek with requests in the Insomnia? It's high time to level-up your game with the 'Request Navigator' plugin! It turns your open requests into tabs faster than a magician pulls rabbits out of a hat. Switching between them is now as simple as hopping from one sitcom episode to another on a lazy Sunday. Fancy some control? Sort or close the tabs as you please - this plugin listens to you better than your pet. It's all about bringing the fun back into your workflow, and making handling multiple requests feel like a walk in the park.
